# Final-Project
#Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss around the world, which makes it essential to develop better automated systems for early detection. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines techniques from multi-label classification and positive-unlabeled (PU) learning to improve how accurately DR can be detected from eye images. Our approach uses an Adaptive Temperature Coefficient (ATC) method to better handle situations where there isnâ€™t enough labeled data available. Instead of just classifying images into clear categories, our method can identify various stages of DR and related eye conditions, which enhances performance in different patient groups. We conducted experiments on popular data sets and found that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy. Additionally, this research opens the door for future studies to combine these advanced methods with automated systems, aiming to create reliable tools for screening diabetic retinopathy, especially in areas with limited resources. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of integrating machine learning with medical imaging to improve detection and treatment of DR.
